# Taxi Reservations System

I made this system while working at Keio Plaza Hotel Shinjuku for managing taxi reservations for guests.

Using VSCode with webpack and Google Firebase.

- Make phone list.
- Change reservations.
- Cancel reservations.
- Print reservations.
- Print day's reservations.
- Settings.
